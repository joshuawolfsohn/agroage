							We often think about industrial pollution in terms of factories and their emissions of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels. Did you know that the agriculture industry also contributes to industrial pollution?
							</p>
							<br>
                            <h4>Holy cow!</h4>
                            <p>
							Since beef and dairy products are so popular, cows area big part of livestock agriculture. 
							Factory farming, aside from its associated animal cruelty issues, is also a major polluter. 
							It is normal for cows to produce methane, a greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming, in small amounts. 
							However, the sheer number of cows involved in factory farming means that the methane emissions add up, making the livestock agriculture industry one of the greatest contributors to global warming via greenhouse gas emissions. 
							By boycotting or eating less beef and dairy products, you can reduce your carbon footprint.
							</p>
							<h4>Produce and transport</h4>
                            <p>
							To get fresh produce to your house, it is more than likely that you have shopped at a grocery store. 
							To get fresh produce to the grocery store, it is usually transported domestically or imported from elsewhere. 
							Next time you go to the grocery store, look at the signs that tell you where the produce was grown - the further the country, the more transportation was required to get the produce to your grocery store.
							Current day freight transportation relies on burning fossil fuels like petroleum, which releases a lot of carbon dioxide - another harmful greenhouse gas. 
							Although the environmental impacts associated with the transportation industry are not directly related to the agriculture industry, Big Ag is still somewhat responsible because of all the produce imports and exports. 
							Aside from boosting your local economy, shopping for produce that is in season at local farmer's markets instead of buying imported produce from grocery stores can also reduce your carbon footprint.
							</p>
							<h4>From land, to lakes</h4>
                            <p>
							Industrial agriculture is also harmful to the environment because of deforestation and water pollution. 
							To make way for fields of crop, forests must be clear cut.
							In general, trees are great for the environment because they can absorb carbon dioxide and emit fresh oxygen. 
							By promoting deforestation, industrial agriculture is preventing the absorption of more carbon dioxide. 
							Likewise, fertilizers and pesticides used on crops by industrial agriculture can run off the ground surface into waterways. 
							It can also penetrate the ground, where it can leach into groundwater and still make its way into waterways. 
							Fertilizers and pesticides can harm aquatic life and, through processes like bioaccumulation, can also harm other wildlife and possibly humans.
							</p>
							<br>
                            <p>
							With Agroage, we hope to help reduce the environmental impacts of Big Ag by helping you grow your own fresh and delicious produce so that you can reduce your dependence on industrial agriculture. We are also trying our best to implement sustainable practices where applicable, from selecting local suppliers to creating packaging made from recycled materials. We hope to see you join us on our journey to make agriculture in the modern age fun, easy, and better for the environment!
