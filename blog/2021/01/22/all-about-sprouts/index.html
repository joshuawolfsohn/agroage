							Like all living things, plants have a life cycle. A typical plant starts as a tiny seed. When the seed comes into contact with water, it begins germinating into a sprout. Sprouts have a small tail-like root that helps sprouts absorb more water and nutrients. When the sprout has enough water and nutrients, it begins growing into a tiny seedling. Seedlings have leaf-like structures to harness energy from the Sun via photosynthesis. Slowly but surely, the seedling of a plant grows into a mature adult plant as it collects more and more water, sunlight, and nutrients.

                            <h4>Why grow sprouts?</h4>
                            <p>Although it can take awhile to fully grow adult plants, sprouts can be grown in a matter of days, making them an attractive option for people who might not want to commit several weeks or months to fully growing a plant. Sprouts are also very versatile - you can use them in soups, salads, stir-fries, sandwiches, and many other dishes, as well as eat them raw in some cases! And while growing plants to their full size requires soil, you only really need water to grow sprouts, so it's super easy - no need to buy a big ol' bag of soil from the store!</p>
							<h4>Beans, beans, they're good for your heart...</h4>
                            <p>Many people shy away from eating legumes (i.e. beans, peas, lentils) because they usually cause a lot of gas. Sprouted legumes, however, are much easier to digest, so you don't have to worry about holding anything in or ventilating your room. Aside from causing less flatulence, sprouted legumes also require less time to be cooked thoroughly compared to their non-sprouted counterparts.</p>
							<h4>What else can I sprout?</h4>
                            <p>Alfalfa, broccoli, sesame, clover, radish, mung beans, green peas, lentils, chickpeas... The list is endless - almost every edible plant can be sprouted and eaten, making sprouting an awesome new way to experience old favourites!</p>
							<br>
                            <p>At Agroage, we recognize that there are so many types of plants that can be sprouted and we want to make it easier for you to try them all. We're still not quite ready to open to the general public, but you can join our Early Access group if you want us to spill the beans on what we're gonna do to make indoor home gardening easy-peasy!</p>
